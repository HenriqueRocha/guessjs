# guess.js
A simple number guessing game.

This is my first Javascript app.
It is adapted from the 
[A first splash into JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash) 
tutorial by Mozilla.

I've been wanting to learn Javascript for many years now but I keep staying just on Android.
Finally, in 2020, it's time to start learning this language.
